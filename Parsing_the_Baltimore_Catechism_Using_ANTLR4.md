The Baltimore Catechism was the official American catholic catechism from long 
before my parents were young.  It was a clear and thorough introduction to the 
Faith, noted for its clear questions with simple but profound answers.  It is 
also delightfully public domain, so it seems worthwhile to convert the text 
into a machine-readable format, such as JSON.  This would make it possible to
write flash cards or games using the questions and answers.
